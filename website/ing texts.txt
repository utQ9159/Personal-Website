Hello, I’m Utku, 24 years old. I am an ambitious, hardworking, and productive aspiring developer with a degree in logistics. I continuously improve myself in the software world, focusing especially on deepening my knowledge in web design. My passion for technology and games forms the foundation of my motivation to learn quickly and easily, and to create innovative solutions.

My language learning journey began in high school when I almost scored zero on an English exam. Instead of seeing this as a barrier, I approached it with determination. Today, I can communicate fluently and at a high level in English with friends I’ve made from all over the world. My passion for learning foreign languages did not stop at just one; I also took sign language classes at university, German lessons at a private language school, and have been studying French and Norwegian on my own at home. Although I don’t claim proficiency in these languages yet, I plan to learn them in the future.

During my high school years, I had the opportunity to intern at Orkun Group, one of Turkey’s largest foreign trade companies. As the company’s first intern at the time, my first day was mostly spent observing how employees worked. On the second day, after gaining detailed knowledge about invoices, documents, and CMR papers, I got involved in the filing process. Thanks to my quick learning ability, I soon became responsible for all the files. Although this significant responsibility was intimidating at first, I worked meticulously, fully aware of the consequences that losing or misplacing even a single document among thousands could cause. I also completed my university internship at the same company. Being familiar with the system by then, I received training on more complex logistics processes. Initially, it felt like searching for a needle in a haystack, as I had to find the necessary materials by scanning the lines on the documents in my hands. These experiences solidified my foundational knowledge in logistics, and with the support of my colleagues, I had both a professional and enjoyable time. I would like to express my gratitude to Orkun Group and my coworkers for the valuable contributions they made to my career.

Throughout my career journey, the various roles I have undertaken in different sectors have helped me build a strong foundation in both work discipline and interpersonal skills. I first worked as an e-commerce coordinator at LC Waikiki. My primary responsibility was to ensure orders were accurately prepared and packaged on time. Working in this fast-paced, constantly moving environment greatly improved my ability to adapt to high-pressure work conditions and manage my time effectively. Later, I worked as an apprentice in a pharmacy, where I quickly gained extensive knowledge about medications and system processes. Despite the long working hours, I maintained my motivation and performed my duties diligently. Additionally, direct communication with patients greatly strengthened my empathy and face-to-face communication skills. Finally, I worked in customer service, where I handled approximately 50 calls per day. This experience sharpened my ability to listen carefully, understand customer needs, and persuade effectively. I also gained valuable skills in quick problem-solving and ensuring customer satisfaction. These diverse experiences have shaped my ability to think critically, adapt quickly, and maintain strong interpersonal relationships.

Reflecting my years-long passion for gaming, I embarked on my childhood dream of becoming a professional player with Apex Legends. Initially, I participated in tryouts and tournaments with hundreds of players to form my own team. This journey was not only about competition but also introduced me to many valuable people whom I still keep in touch with today. Although the game didn’t have a large player base in Turkey yet, my friends and I, who shared this passion, created our own community. Quickly reaching over 500 members, we successfully organized many events and created a dynamic environment for players to come together. To grow and sustain this community, we engaged in sponsorship talks with various companies and individuals. With support from our sponsors and our own resources, the events we organized helped increase interest in the game and invigorate the competitive scene. Together with my team, we achieved many successes in local tournaments. Inspired by our growing experience and improving performance, I proposed the idea of competing on global stages. Along with players who believed in this vision, we underwent months of disciplined preparation. Ultimately, we competed on the same stage as Europe’s top teams, reaching three finals and ranking in the top 20 out of over 500 teams. I signed my first professional contract in 2023 with Istanbul Wildcats (now Bushido Wildcats). During this period, we participated in national and international tournaments. I always knew I was more than just a player. Therefore, I focused not only on my own development but also on helping my teammates and those around me grow. I coached them, analyzed their weaknesses, and did my best to help them become their best selves. After three years filled with countless achievements, hundreds of meaningful friendships, and unforgettable moments, I proudly concluded my esports career.

I have explored many regions of Turkey and had the chance to get to know the local culture in each city up close. Collecting memories and tasting regional flavors wherever I go has become indispensable for me. Although I haven’t traveled abroad yet, I have a long travel list, and my next goal is to complete these routes step by step.

Music is an indispensable passion that accompanies every moment of my life. From the video games I played as a child to traveling, sports, and reading books, I have always felt the influence of rhythms. Rather than lyrics, it is the melodic structure and rhythm of music that fascinates me. Although I do not play an instrument, I have had a special interest in the violin and piano since childhood. One day, I aim to play these two instruments at an advanced level.

My introduction to video games came in elementary school thanks to an arcade machine, and since then, this passion has held a significant place in my life. Starting with the 2D action-RPG game AQW, which I played on a small-screen notebook when I was around 8 or 9 years old, my gaming experience gradually expanded to dozens of different genres. After acquiring my own computer, I have enjoyed countless games. Even today, video games continue to shape both my social circle and my perspective on life. Regardless of my age, I will carry this passion inside me throughout every phase of my life.
